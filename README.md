# Tourist Website
--------

Tourist Website is another webpage for the tourist out there. This website gives you the information about Nepal and its culture. Users are able to scroll, sort and put favourites to the places that they never visited.<br />
Tourist Website is made from HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript. It also uses MySQL as a storage medium. Due to limited resources, I wasn't not able to keep up on the free host server and the backend was on php so github couldn't launch the site. So we made it into static page but feel free to download the website and run for yourself in your xampp server. A dynamic tourist webpage can be made with this codebase if contributors are there to help. Everybody is welcome!!<br />
